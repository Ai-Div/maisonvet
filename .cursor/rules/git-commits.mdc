# Git commits

When committing changes in this project:

**Do not add Co-authored-by or Co-Authored-By lines to commit messages.** Examples of what must not appear:

- `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>`
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

Use only the commit message itself (summary and optional body).
